<h1> Midterm Assignment: A Children's Spelling Game made with Processing </h1>
Our prompt for this midterm assignment was to create a game. I thought this would be a great chance to delve deeper into my interest in my education and explore developing a simple children's game.
<h4>How it Works</h4>
It is a basic spelling game, where a visual of an animal is displayed on a screen and the player has to click on letter blocks to spell out the animal's name. 

<h4>Design Choices</h4>
I was mostly excited about the design possibilities that developing a children's game opens up. For the color palette, I went for neutral and pastel colors. Readability and accessibility were key principles that I kept in mind, not only when choosing the colors but also when choosing the typeface. I went with OpenDyslexic to make sure that everything is as legible as possible, since text is the most crucial part of the game.
