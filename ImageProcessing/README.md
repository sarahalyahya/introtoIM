<h1>Image Processing: 2020, so far</h1> 
For this assignment, we were meant to apply image processing and manipulation techniques we looked at in class to create an artwork with Processing. 
I've been really interested in the idea of glitch art, and at the time, I was reflecting a lot on 2020 as a year and made an analogy in my brain that looking back at the year is like watching my memories through a glitch old TV. So, I decided to recreate this analogy, and code the glitches. 

<h4>Process</h4>
I picked a photo from my gallery to represent each month so far. Then, I coded the images into a TV frame and applied different glitches that I made through playing around with code. The end result is a TV that goes through each month and its image while glitching, and accompanying text that states what I've been grateful for.
