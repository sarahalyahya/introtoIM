<h1>LED Puzzle</h1>
Our assignment was to create a puzzle with our Arduino Uno. It was my first time working with it, and it was very interesting to observe the differences between debugging a circuit and debugging code. 
I decided to create an LED puzzle, the goal was to press the buttons in a specific order based on a given riddle, to get all LEDs to light up. 

<h4> Puzzle Prompt</h4>
The instructions I gave the users were: </br>
  1. You need six steps to achieve the task  </br>
  2. These steps have a specific order/sequence </br>
  3. You can press a maximum of two buttons at the same time  </br>
  4.  Here's a riddle to give you a hint: 
</br>


         *"You see me in the air </br>
        But I am not a kite</br>
        I am what's created</br>
        When water refracts light</br>"*
        
<h4>Solution</h4>
The solution is inspired by the colors of the rainbow which I considered to be (Red,Orange,Yellow,Green,Blue,Violet). </br>
So, here are the steps to the solution:

1. Press Red Button
2. Press Red + Yellow Buttons
3. Press Yellow Button
4. Press Green Button
5. Press Blue Button
6. Press Blue + Red Buttons
