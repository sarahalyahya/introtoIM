<h1>Final Project: CONNECTED</h1>
<h3>by Sarah Al-Yahya and Ons Taktak</h3>
For our final project, we are expected to create something that includes functionality both through processing and through our Arduino board. Ons an I showed a lot of interest in generative art throughout the semester, and so this was our starting point for this project. 

<h4>Concept</h4>
We created an experience where two users answer questions that are meant to explore how similar they are to each other by mapping the data from their answers onto the screen, and then visualizing this data gradually as users interact with our Arduino set-up by turning potentiometers and moving a trace on the screen. This visualization occurs when users intersect in an area of a question where they answered similarly. The intensity of this bloom indicates how alike the users are. 
At the end of the game, users have the option to save their connection screen and possibly take it home as an expression of friendship.
